0-malloc_checked.c contains a function that allocates memory using malloc.
 1. string_nconcat
1-string_nconcat.c contains a function that concatenates two strings.
 2. _calloc
2-calloc.c contains a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc.
 3. array_range
3-array_range.c contains a function that creates an array of integers.
 4. _realloc
100-realloc.c contains a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free.
 5. We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope
101-mul.c is a program that multiplies two positive numbers passed as command line arguments.
