# Variadic Functions
This project contains C tasks for learning about variadic functions.

Tasks Completed
 0. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant
0-sum_them_all.c contains a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
 1. To be is to be the value of a variable
1-print_numbers.c contains a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
 2. One woman's constant is another woman's variable
2-print_strings.c contains a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
 3. To be is a to be the value of a variable
3-print_all.c contains a function that prints anything.
 4. Real programmers can write assembly code in any language
100-hello_holberton.asm is a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.
# HINTS General
âœ” Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
âœ” All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
âœ” All your files should end with a new line
âœ” A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
ðŸ§¨Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
ðŸ§¨You are not allowed to use global variables
ðŸŽˆNo more than 5 functions per file
ðŸŽˆThe only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etcâ€¦ is forbidden
You are allowed to use the following macros: va_start, va_arg and va_end
You are allowed to use _putchar
You donâ€™t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it wonâ€™t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo (if you do we wonâ€™t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called variadic_functions.h
Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
